## Task 1 Q1 :
```
 Use the MATLAB bode function to plot the magnitude and phase
 characteristics of the 3-pole Butterworth low-pass filter with unity gain and
 normalized frequency at Ï‰ = 1 rad/sec. Print your code, results and figures.
```
## Solution :
Using the general rule at k=3  :

## Task 1 Q2 :

```
 Use the MATLAB buttap and lp2lp functions to find the transfer function
 of a third-order Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff frequency fc =
 2KHz. Then, plot its frequency response. Print your code, results and figures.
```

## Solution :
```
% it is a 3-pole Butterworth low-pass filter with cut off freq fc=2KHz 
[zeros , poles , k] = buttap(3);
% calcuate coeffecients of b(numerator) and a (denominator)
[b,a] = zp2tf ( zeros, poles , k);
% range the frequency and convert it to rad/sec(angular)
freq = 1000:30:10000;
w = 2*pi*freq;
% declare cutoff frequency and convert it to rad/sec(angular)
freqc = 2*1000 ;  % we multiplied by 1000 to convert kHZ to HZ
wc = 2*pi*freqc; 
% here calculate the new coefficents after low pass to low pass filter 
% let their names bnew , anew
% for explaination we are converting from analog values to angular domain 
[ bnew , anew ] = lp2lp(b , a, wc); 
% lets calculate The transfer function of the  new filtered  
Gofs = freqs(bnew , anew , w);
semilogx(w, abs(Gofs));      % plot it 
% add grid lines
grid;
hold on ;

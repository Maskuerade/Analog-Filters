## Task 1 Q1 :
```
 Use the MATLAB bode function to plot the magnitude and phase
 characteristics of the 3-pole Butterworth low-pass filter with unity gain and
 normalized frequency at Ï‰ = 1 rad/sec. Print your code, results and figures.
```

## Task 1 Q2 :

```
 Use the MATLAB buttap and lp2lp functions to find the transfer function
 of a third-order Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff frequency fc =
 2KHz. Then, plot its frequency response. Print your code, results and figures.
